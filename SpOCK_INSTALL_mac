The directory where SpOCK is installed is noted <spock_dir>. 

To install SpOCK, administrator privileges are not required.

Running SpOCK assumes you're using the bash shell. 
To check if your default shell is bash, type in a Terminal command prompt: echo $SHELL
If it returns: /bin/bash
then your default shell is bash and you're good to start the installation.
If it returns something else, it means your default shell isn't bash. You can either temporarily or 
permanently change your shell to bash.
To permanently change your shell to bash, type in a Terminal command prompt: chsh -s /bin/bash
It will ask for your password. After typing your password, close and open a new Terminal window for this 
change to be effective.
To temporarily change you shell to bash, type in a Terminal command prompt: /bin/bash
(echo $SHELL will still return a different shell but that's ok).
If you choose to change your shell only temporarily, you'll need to type this command ("/bin/bash") in the Terminal 
each time you open a new window to run SpOCK.


- test if mpirun is already installed on your computer: 
   - in a Terminal command line, type: mpirun
   - if the following message is returned then you need to download and install OpenMpi: 
   "mpirun: command not found". 
   If you get a message with "OpenMpi could not find anything to do" then you already have 
   OpenMpi installed so you can skip the next step "download and install OpenMpi" and go to 
   the step "In a new Terminal window"
- download and install OpenMpi (if you don't already have it):
   - go online to: https://www.open-mpi.org/software/
   - in the first table, select the version "openmpi-X.Y.Z.tar.gz" (where X, Y, and Z are numbers)
   - in the Terminal, cd to the Downloads directory (usually /Users/<username>/Downloads)
   - tar -zxvf openmpi-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
   - cd to the folder created by the previous "tar -zxvf openmpi-X.Y.Z.tar.gz" step (at the time 
   of writing: cd openmpi-4.1.0)
   - if you have administrator privileges: 
      - ./configure 
      - sudo make all install (this step takes time) 
   - if you don't have administrator privileges:
      - ./configure --prefix=/Users/<username> (don't forget to replace <username> with your username)
      - make all install (this step takes time)
      - open the file /Users/<username>/.bash_profile (if this file doesn't exist then create it)
      - add the following line in the file /Users/<username>/.bash_profile: 
	 PATH=$PATH:/Users/<username>/bin
   	 (don't forget to replace <username> with your username)
      - save the file /Users/<username>/.bash_profile
You're done installing OpenMpi.

In a NEW Terminal window:
- cd <spock_dir>
- mkdir gsl_installation

- Download and install GSL C version:
   - go online to http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ 
   - in Section "Downloading GSL", select the link of "your nearest GNU mirror"
   - scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and select "gsl-latest.tar.gz"
   - in Terminal: 
      - cd to the Downloads directory (usually /Users/<username>/Downloads)
      - tar -zxvf gsl-latest.tar.gz (if there is no gsl-latest.tar.gz then try "tar -zxvf gsl-latest.tar")
      - cd to the GSL folder created by this previous "tar -zxvf gsl-latest.tar.gz" step (at the time of 
      writing: cd gsl-2.6)
      - ./configure --prefix=<spock_dir>/gsl_installation/ (the --prefix option will install GSL in the 
	 gsl_installation folder previously created so that administrator privileges are not required for 
	 the installation. If you don't want to install GSL in this directory, you'll have to modify the 
	 makeall.sh accordingly (see further step))
      - make (this step might take several minutes)
      - make install (IF (and only if) you didn't use the option --prefix two steps before, then you might 
	 need administrator privileges: sudo make install)
You're done installing GSL.

- Download and install SPICE for C:
   - go online to: http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit_C.html
   - select the 64-bit Mac version "Mac/Intel, OSX, Apple C, 64bit"
   - download cspice.tar.Z (you don't need to download the other files. In particular, don't follow the 
   instructions of the README file. At the time of writing, they don't work properly. Instead, follow
    the following steps)
   - in the Terminal:
      - cd to the Download directory (usually /Users/<username>/Downloads)
      - cp cspice.tar.Z <spock_dir>
      - cd <spock_dir>
      - tar -zxvf cspice.tar.Z
      - cd cspice
      - ./makeall.csh (this might take a few minutes)
You're done installing SPICE.

- Install wget:
   - you might already have wget. To find out, type in a Terminal command prompt: wget. If it returns:
   "wget: command not found" then you need to install wget. If if returns something else, then you 
   don't need to install wget and you can directly go to the final step "Install SpOCK".
   - go online to: http://rudix.org/packages/wget.html
   - select the .pkg file corresponding to your platform
   - follow the steps for the installation. If you need administrator privileges for the installation 
   and you don't have them, there are other ways you can install wget (email cbv@umich.edu for help)

- Install SpOCK:
   - still in the Terminal:
      - cd <spock_dir> 
      - ./makeall.sh (IF (and only if) you installed GSL in another directory than gsl_installation 
      (see step "./configure in the installation of GSL") then modify the variable "path_gsl" in makeall.sh)
      - source ~/.bash_profile 
You're done installing SpOCK.

- Give it a try!
   - open the file <spock_dir>/Examples/try_spock.txt and modify the line below #SPICE to: <spock_dir>/cspice/data 
   (don't forget to change <spock_dir> with the directory where SpOCK was installed).  
   For example, if spock_dir is /Users/smith/spock then the line under #SPICE should be 
   /Users/smith/spock/cspice/data. Then save try_spock.txt and go back to the Terminal 
   - cd <spock_dir>/Examples
   - mpirun -np 2 spock try_spock.txt
If the installation of SpOCK went well, then you shouldn't see any error. 
The message:
"SpOCK is propagating the spacecraft... 100%

- Done propagating the spacecraft."
should be printed on the terminal.
